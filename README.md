**********************************************
Software for a linked list implementation, where the user can select if a new element

a.) is pushed to the head (beginning) 

b.) is appended to the end of the tail (end)  

of the linked list

through it from the head.

This was a task as part of the C# developer line at Fernakademie Klett.
